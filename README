This project is the implementation of a 3D world consisting
of terrain, trees, roads and the like; including a number of extensions.
See spec.pdf for the original assignment specification .

Bezier terrain looks pretty cool, though is kinda slow. At this point
I'll aim to maintain 30FPS on a 20x20 map (on Intel HD3000).
To use bezier implementation, build with

  make bezierterrain && make

else, simply build with

  make

The following features are of interest:

  * Fullscreen may be toogled by the 'f' key
  * Rain may be toggled by the 'k' key. (Note that sun/stars are
    displayed in the absence of rain.)
  * Daytime may be toggled by the 'j' key.
  * Keyboard shortcuts may be adjusted via the maps in assets/kbd.
    By default standard qwerty and dvp are supported.
  * Earth rotation may be toggled by 'i'.
