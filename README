This project is the implementation of a 3D world consisting
of terrain, trees, roads and the like; including a number of extensions.
See spec.pdf for the original assignment specification .

----

The following was included in the original submssion's README:

Json is not supported because this program's IO was finalized before
the spec was. Please run
make levelgen && ./levelgen c < pathtojson > pathtonative
to generate an appopriate level file for the application.

The base functionality has been implemented.

The following extensions have been implemented:
  - avatar/3rdperson (press 'o' to toggle)
  - night mode (press 'i' to toggle)
  - sun changes color and rotates (press 'c' to toggle)
  - roads on arbitrary terrain 
      (see "assets/levels/ext/roads" as an demonstration level)
  - rain ('k' to toggle)

The following additional features have been implemented:
  - wasd/mouse work as you would expect
      (though obviously arrow keys are retained for compatibility)
  - noclip (press 'l' to toggle)
  - 'p' will pause the game
  - keyboard mapping support
    (sounds a bit silly at first, but after putting up with changing
    my keyboard to qwerty every time i want to play starcraft, this is
    totally worth it)
  - fullscreen (press 'f' to toggle)
  - qq (press 'q')

Quickstart guide:
  make
  ./main assets/levels/ext/roads
  fki
